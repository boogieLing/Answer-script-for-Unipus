# Answer-script-for-Unipus

Since manually completing the questions on Unipus is too cumbersome for me, I completed a script that can automatically obtain the answers to the multiple choice questions and automatically fill in the blank questions...

## Unipus Killer

For [https://sso.unipus.cn/](https://sso.unipus.cn/)

## Features


 1. Automatically crawl answers to questions corresponding to url
 
 2. Fill in the blanks automatically

## How to use

 1. Open the main **program**, open the **browser.**
 
 2. Fill the **URL** of the topic you want to find into the software.
 
 3. If you only need to check the answer, please click **"JUST ANSWER"**
 
 4. If you need to fill in the answer automatically (you cannot fill in the multiple choice question automatically), please click  **"I AM LAZY"**

## Remarks

 1.The input method should be ==English== input when filling in the blank.
 
 2. If a parameter error occurs, modify the parameters **"user-agent" "X-ANNOTATOR-AUTH-TOKEN"**, these parameters can be found in your F12 interface. If you do not understand, you can contact the author.
 
 3. At present, only the executable file of the **LINUX** version is released. If you need the **WINDOWS** version, you can compile it yourself, or you can **contact the author.**
